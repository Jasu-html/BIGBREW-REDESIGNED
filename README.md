# BigBrew Promotional Website Redesign (In Progress)

This repository contains the ongoing project for the **BigBrew Promotional Website Redesign**, created as part of my final project for the **CIS-211** course. The goal is to redesign the **BigBrew** website with a modern, user-friendly interface, improving both its aesthetics and functionality.

At this stage, the website is still under development. This README serves to provide an overview of the project, its current state, and the technologies being used.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

The **BigBrew Promotional Website** redesign aims to improve the user experience by modernizing the interface of the website. The website will feature key sections, including the menu, promotional content, franchise information, and more.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

The following technologies are being used to develop the BigBrew promotional website:

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling, ensuring the website is visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website (to be added in the later stages).
- **Responsive Design**: To ensure the website works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 🚀 **Current State**

As of now, the project is **still under development**, and the following aspects are still in progress:

- **HTML structure**: The basic HTML structure is yet to be created.
- **CSS layout**: A rough layout and design is yet to be created and are still being refined.
- **JavaScript functionality**: Interactivity (such as animations, button clicks, and other dynamic features) is yet to be implemented.
- **Responsive Design**: The mobile responsiveness is under development and needs further fine-tuning.

## ⚠️ **Work in Progress**

- The project is currently in the **design phase**. Some sections are functional, but many areas are still being worked on.
